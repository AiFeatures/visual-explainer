## Carried Patches

Local commits ahead of `upstream/main` at last review:

- `e4ce2c3 chore(release): add release.yml + .releaserc.json (#3)`
- `ca8c874 docs: refresh README to match current repo state (#2)`
- `345f427 chore: sync CLAUDE.md and copilot-instructions docs`
- `34be022 feat: register as agent-hub skill with manifest`
- `e9c4d2e ci: add dependabot.yml for iAiFy governance`
- `e89a852 docs: add AGENTS.md for iAiFy governance`
- `48bfb56 docs: add copilot-instructions.md for iAiFy governance`
- `5736265 docs: add CLAUDE.md for iAiFy governance`

## Supported Components

- Root governance files (`.github/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `FORK-CUSTOMIZATIONS.md`)
- Enterprise CI/CD workflows imported from `Ai-road-4-You/enterprise-ci-cd`

## Out of Support

- All upstream source directories are tracked as upstream-of-record; local edits to core source are discouraged.

## Breaking-Change Policy

1. On upstream sync, classify per `governance/docs/fork-governance.md`.
2. Breaking API/license/security changes auto-classify as `manual-review-required`.
3. Owner triages within 5 business days; conflicts are logged to the `fork-sync-failure` issue label.
4. Revert local customizations only after stakeholder sign-off.

## Sync Strategy

This fork follows the [Fork Governance Policy](https://github.com/Ai-road-4-You/governance/blob/main/docs/fork-governance.md)
and the [Fork Upstream Merge Runbook](https://github.com/Ai-road-4-You/governance/blob/main/docs/runbooks/fork-upstream-merge.md).

- **Sync frequency**: quarterly
- **Conflict resolution**: Prefer upstream; reapply iAiFy customizations on a sync branch
- **Automation**: [`Ai-road-4-You/fork-sync`](https://github.com/Ai-road-4-You/fork-sync) workflows
- **Failure handling**: Sync failures create issues tagged `fork-sync-failure`

## Decision: Continue, Rebase, Refresh, or Replace

| Option | Current Assessment |
|---|---|
| Continue maintaining fork | yes - governance overlay only |
| Full rebase onto upstream | feasible on request |
| Fresh fork (discard local changes) | acceptable |
| Replace with upstream directly | possible |
